LibYAML wrapper for Marmalade (subproject)

[LibYAML](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML) is fast [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) parser and emitter.

You can read through [documentation](http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML#Documentation) and check the [samples](https://bitbucket.org/xi/libyaml/src/tip/tests/).

Include the subproject libyaml into your project and you are ready to go. :)
